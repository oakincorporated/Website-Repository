    <p>We are a group of six students, from three different degrees. This website and the application that have been created are part 
        of our 206CDE "Real world project" assessment at Coventry University. As we are a diverse group we have
        got to learn from each other and develop new skills, challenging ourselves with concepts we would not have had to
        face otherwise. We started off as three ITB, one Computer Science and two Computing students. Given unforseen circumstances,
        two ITB students had to leave and they were replaced by two Computer Sciece students. That did not affect us, as
        we quickly got together and started working together towards our final goal.</p><br>
    <p>The aim of the project was to create an alternative attendance system for our university. We decided on working with
        NFC stickers as a replacement for the current RFID cards. NFC stickers are cheaper, less bulky and easier to replace.
        We have worked on the project as a team, helping each other and learning new concepts. So far we have an mobile application
        that is related to the stickers themselves, we are able to register attendance and create personalized reports, and
        we have recently developed this website, which is similar in functionality to the mobile application. We have learned PHP,
        HTML, optimal data storage concepts, CSS and technical aspects of the NFC tags. We have improved our SQLite, Javascript
        and Software Development Lifecycle skills. Working as a team also further improved our soft skills such as communication,
        time management and teamworking.</p>
